We met before when the reports were due to plan few things about how we can approach the particular parts of the app. Then we worked on our reports. To give more details, on the 10th of April, we made the first significant progress for our project. In the second week of April, we wrote the UI of our project and then we learned SQL and found the Google cloud for our database. In April we mainly focused on the UI of our project. At the end of April, we focused on the database and we tried to implement notifications, pop-ups, chat, create activities, etc. Also At the end of April, we have made good progress. In May, we worked a lot on the project implementation. We discussed UI and improved it a lot during the process. Also, we finished our database tables and all the SQL code. To talk about the last week of the project, we worked everyday from 8 am to 12 pm. Some codes broke the other codes and we fixed all the bugs. Furthermore, we made a lot of improvements in UI such as colors. We also discussed about recommendation system and worked on some methods in our project. In the end, we are very happy with what we have produced as a project.
